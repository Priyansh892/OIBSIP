        <h1> <u><i>Biography</i></u> </h1>
        <p> Mahatma Gandhi, byname of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, (born October 2, 1869, Porbandar, India—died January
            30, 1948, Delhi), Indian lawyer, politician, social activist, and writer who became the leader of the
            nationalist movement against the British rule of India. As such, he came to be considered the father of his
            country. Gandhi is internationally esteemed for his doctrine of nonviolent protest (satyagraha) to achieve
            political and social progress.

            In the eyes of millions of his fellow Indians, Gandhi was the Mahatma (“Great Soul”). The unthinking
            adoration of the huge crowds that gathered to see him all along the route of his tours made them a severe
            ordeal; he could hardly work during the day or rest at night. “The woes of the Mahatmas,” he wrote, “are
            known only to the Mahatmas.” His fame spread worldwide during his lifetime and only increased after his
            death. The name Mahatma Gandhi is now one of the most universally recognized on earth.</p>
